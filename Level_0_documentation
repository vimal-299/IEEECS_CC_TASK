DOUBLY LINKED LISTS 
The class linked_list creates a doubly linked list with the following functionality:

  1. Node creation - A seperate class named node containing the following attributes :
    1.(a) data - This stores the value in the node
    1.(b) next - Points towards the next node
    1.(c) prev - Points towards the previous node

  2. Length - Calculates the length of the doubly linked list
     Time complexity - O(n)
     space complexity - O(1)

  3. Insertion_head - Adds an element to the starting of the list
     Time complexity - O(1)
     space complexity - O(1)

  4. Insertion_tail - Adds an element to the end of the list
     Time complexity - O(n)
     space complexity - O(1)

  5. traversal_forward - Prints the elements of the list from head to tail
     Time complexity - O(n)
     space complexity - O(1)

  6. traversal_backward - Prints the elements of the list from tail to head
     Time complexity - O(n)
     space complexity - O(1)
