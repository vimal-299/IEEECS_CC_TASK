COMPOSITE DATA STRUCTURE IMPLEMENTATION

This class maintains a collection of intervals and merges overlapping intervals to keep a simplified representation.

Attributes:
    intervals (list): A list that stores the non-overlapping merged intervals.

Methods:
    addIntervals(start, end): Adds a new interval and merges overlapping intervals.
    getIntervals(): Returns the current list of merged intervals.

Time Complexity:
    - addIntervals: O(n log n) due to sorting and merging.
    - getIntervals: O(n), as it prints the stored intervals.
