# IEEECS_CC_TASK

I Successfully solved first level and second level of the competitive coding tasks 
For the first task a stack was implemented that allows retrieving the minimum and maximum elements in constant time O(1).
For the second task an interval merger was created which is a utility to merge overlapping intervals efficiently.
