# IEEECS_CC_TASK

I Successfully solved level 0 , 1 , and 2 of the competitive coding tasks using python. 
For the level 0 task a doubly linked list was implemented with functionalities like inserting element in head and tail , traversal in forward and backwards and printing the elements . 
For the level 1 task a stack was implemented that allows retrieving the minimum and maximum elements in constant time O(1). 
For the level 2 task an interval merger was created which is a utility to merge overlapping intervals efficiently.
