Time Complexity of all functions - O(1)
Space Complexity of all functions = O(n)

CUSTOM DATA STRUCTURE IMPLEMENTATION :
The class implements a stack data structure with additional functionality.
Attributes:
    stack (deque): The main stack to store elements.
    max_stack (deque): Stack to keep track of maximum values.
    min_stack (deque): Stack to keep track of minimum values.

Methods:
    push(x): Inserts an element into the stack while updating min and max stacks.
    pop(): Removes the top element from the stack and updates min and max stacks.
    top(): Returns the top element of the stack.
    getMin(): Returns the minimum element in the stack.
    getMax(): Returns the maximum element in the stack.
